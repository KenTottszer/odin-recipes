    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Burrito is the PERFECT grab-and-go meal made with chicken breast, Mexican rice, refried beans, cheddar cheese, and seasoning, wrapped in a flour tortilla and frozen until you need it!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 red or white onion, or 4 spring onions, chopped</li>
        <li> 400g mixed vegetables of your choice (we used carrots, red pepper and sweetcorn)</li>
        <li>200g leftover chicken, chopped into small chunks</li>
        <li>  2 x 250g packs ready-cooked lime & coriander rice</li>
        <li>400g can red kidney beans in chilli sauce</li>
        <li> 6 large wraps</li>
        <li> 1 avocado, chopped</li>
        <li>100g grated cheddar</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the onion and cook for 5 mins until soft, then add your chosen veggies and continue cooking for another 5-10 mins or until tender. Add the leftover meat, the rice and beans, along with the sauce from the can. Stir everything together and cook for 5 mins until piping hot.</li>
        <li>Heat another frying pan, or a griddle pan, until hot, and heat oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 2. Now assemble the burritos. Warm a wrap for 10 secs on the hot pan (keep the pan hot, you'll need to use it again).</li>
        <li>Pile roughly a sixth of the rice mixture onto the centre of the wrap. Top with a little avocado and some cheese, then brush beaten egg around the edge. Fold the ends over the filling, then fold in the sides, like an envelope.</li>
        <li>Flatten a little to a parcel, then place, seam-side down, in the hot pan. Cook for 2 mins until the underside has sealed shut and is toasted a golden brown, flip over and cook for a few mins more.</li>
        <li>Keep the burrito warm in the oven while you continue assembling and cooking the remaining burritos. Serve with soured cream, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
